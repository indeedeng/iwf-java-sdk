Java SDK for [iWF workflow engine](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf)

See [samples](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf-java-samples) for how to use this SDK to build your workflow.

## Requirements

- Java 1.8+

## How to use

Here is
the [link to all the versions on Maven](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/iworkflow/iwf-java-sdk/) available to use. It gets replicated from [staging repo](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/io/iworkflow/iwf-java-sdk/) after 30-60 minutes.

Also the [Java docs for the latest version](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/io.iworkflow/iwf-java-sdk/latest/index.html).
For the latest version, [MVN Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.iworkflow/iwf-java-sdk) website may have
1~2 days delay to show up.

### Gradle

```gradle
// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.iworkflow/iwf-java-sdk
implementation 'io.iworkflow:iwf-java-sdk:2.5.+'
```

### Maven

```
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.iworkflow/iwf-java-sdk -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.iworkflow</groupId>
    <artifactId>iwf-java-sdk</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.+</version>
    <type>pom</type>
</dependency>

```

## Concepts

To implement a workflow, the two most core interfaces are

* [Workflow interface](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf-java-sdk/blob/main/src/main/java/io/iworkflow/core/ObjectWorkflow.java)
  defines the workflow definition

* [WorkflowState interface](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf-java-sdk/blob/main/src/main/java/io/iworkflow/core/WorkflowState.java)
  defines the workflow states for workflow definitions

A workflow can contain any number of WorkflowStates.

## How to build & run

### Using IntelliJ

1. Check out the idl submodule by running the command: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
2. In "Build, Execution, Deployment" -> "Gradle", choose "wrapper task in Gradle build script" for "Use gradle from".
3. Open Gradle tab, click "build" under "build" to build the project

## Development Guide

### Update IDL

Run the command `git submodule update --remote --merge` to update IDL to the latest commit

### Local testing

If you'd like to test your changes to the SDK with the workflows in the [samples](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf-java-samples) repo, 
use the local publishing command:

1. Run:
  ```
  ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -x signMavenJavaPublication
  ```
2. In the [samples](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf-java-samples) repo, make sure your `build.gradle` depends on the same version you just published, then run:
  ```
   ./gradlew --refresh-dependencies build
  ```
3. Once you're done, to remove the locally published version, run:
  ```
  ./gradlew unpublishFromMavenLocal
  ```
